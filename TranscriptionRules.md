# Transcription rules

## Additions

Inline additions by another hand than the main scribe are not marked.

Interlinear additions (of not more than single letters) are marked in the main line with "↑()" or "↓()". In case of whole words, they are transcribed on an extra line (of type "InterlinearLine") and the point of insertion is marked with "↑" or "↓" (without the parentheses) in the main text line.

Additions in the margins are on their own lines (and in their own regions). If there is a sign referring to them in the main text line, it may be marked with arrows ("↡", "↟", "←" and "→") directing in the direction of the position of the annotation in the margin. For more complex margin commentaries, this will not work out...

## Deletions

Deletions of text or unreadable letters (by the scribe or by damage) are written between double brackets ("⟦" and "⟧"). Not readable letters are represented by "_".

## Nomina sacra

Nomina sacra are put in their abbreviated form (as in the manuscript) in parentheses.

## Diakritika

Diakritika are transcribed exactly as in the manuscript with the exception that diakritika on diphthongs are put on the second letter and not on the first letter as mostly in the manuscripts.

## Interpunction

Interpunction should be transcribed as in the manuscript. As the transcription will be normalized to Unicode NFC, "U+0387 GREEK ANO TELEIA" will actually be normalized to "U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT", so this cannot be used to discern between middle dot and high dot in some of the manuscripts.
